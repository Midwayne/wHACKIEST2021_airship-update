Contact tracing program

A program which stores the details and duration of people going to a store. If anyone who had gone to the store has tests positive for covid, the program will give the details of the people who are possible effected, them being who were at the store when the person entered and anyone who comes in after.



When first entering the menu, select the customer entry option and enter  the required deatils.
When the customer exits the store they select the customer exit option, which prompts them to enter their number.

After all the customer details and exits have been stored, the report button can be used. Then you'll be asked to enter the number of the person infected, after which all the details of the people who had come in contact with the person is shown.
